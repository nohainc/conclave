# First-Party Worker Testing

Provider integrations are tested through the generic CLI Worker Engine and
signed Tool Profiles.

## Deterministic acceptance

The generic Engine tests use fixture CLIs and provider event fixtures. Run the
relevant suites with:

~~~sh
cd engines/cli_worker && dart test
cd packages/tool-profile && pnpm test
cd apps/workspace && flutter test
~~~

These tests do not require provider accounts or use provider allowance.

## Real provider acceptance

The opt-in [Profile acceptance suite](../roadmaps/ARCHITECTURE_V8_IMPLEMENTATION.md#release-gates)
uses the installed Codex and Antigravity CLIs. It writes digest-bound evidence
for passive/live probes, a Thread write, durable session start/resume,
timeout, and process-tree cancellation. Set only the corresponding opt-in
variable and an evidence directory when an operator is ready to run it:

~~~sh
CONCLAVE_TEST_REAL_PROFILE_CHATGPT=1 \
CONCLAVE_PROFILE_ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE_DIR=/path/to/evidence \
  dart test test/tool_profile_real_acceptance_test.dart

CONCLAVE_TEST_REAL_PROFILE_GEMINI=1 \
CONCLAVE_PROFILE_ACCEPTANCE_EVIDENCE_DIR=/path/to/evidence \
  dart test test/tool_profile_real_acceptance_test.dart
~~~

From `apps/workspace`, the live assignment suite covers Work (`direct`), Plan & Implement,
Implement & Verify, and Full Cycle for both logical Workers. It uses provider
allowance and does not replace the evidence-producing release acceptance
suite.

Chat adds a distinct read-only qualification requirement. Normal and compatibility
Profile layouts must preserve policy on both new and resumed conversations.
Fixture coverage is recorded in [Chat/Work regression coverage](../acceptance/CHAT_WORKFLOW.md);
it does not replace live-provider sandbox qualification. Historical evidence
continues to use the Workflow names and versions that were tested.

~~~sh
CONCLAVE_TEST_REAL_PROFILE_CHATGPT=1 \
CONCLAVE_TEST_REAL_PROFILE_GEMINI=1 \
  dart test test/tool_profile_assignment_acceptance_test.dart
~~~

Use Dart's standalone test runner for these Workspace acceptance files. It
avoids Flutter test-runner service output being inherited by the Engine child
process, whose stdout is reserved for the local worker protocol.

Live-provider acceptance remains a release gate. The generic Engine fixture
suite provides deterministic coverage without provider accounts or allowance.

The 2026-10-03 local result record is at
[`docs/acceptance/real-provider/2026-10-03`](../acceptance/real-provider/2026-10-03/README.md).
Codex passed all four assignments. Gemini's Profile evidence suite passed, but
two assignment workflows still need to be rerun after configuring a scoped
headless command permission for the isolated acceptance workspace. The Testing
Workspace channel-store test passed locally; no Cloud release or remote channel
was changed.
