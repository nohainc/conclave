# Conclave Protocol Boundaries

**Status:** Current product boundary contract. Local Worker Protocol 4.0 is the Workspace-to-Engine contract.
**Applies to:** Conclave AX, Conclave Cloud, Conclave Workspace, and the CLI Worker Engine.

Conclave has three protocol boundaries. They share domain vocabulary, but each
boundary has its own endpoints, authentication, transport, versioning, and wire
schemas.

```text
Conclave AX  <->  Conclave Cloud
                 Human Product Protocol

Conclave Workspace  <->  Conclave Cloud
                       Workspace Runtime Protocol

Conclave Workspace  <->  CLI Worker Engine process
                       Local Worker Protocol 4.0
```

The arrows show the three product/runtime boundaries. The Human Product
Protocol is primarily the AX-to-Cloud surface and includes only the
owner-authenticated Workspace management routes explicitly defined by
ADR-013/ADR-014. Cloud may implement both human-facing endpoints and the
Workspace Gateway, but those are separate surfaces with separate
authentication and contracts.

## 1. AX ↔ Cloud — Human Product Protocol

**Endpoints:** Conclave AX and Conclave Cloud's human-facing API/realtime
endpoints.  
**Authentication:** a human user session.  
**Transport:** HTTPS APIs and browser realtime connections.  
**Contract ownership:** Cloud publishes the API/read-model contracts consumed
by AX; AX owns human-facing product behavior.

This protocol carries Projects, Workstreams, collaboration, Workstream
execution policy, Workspace grants, human-readable Workspace/Worker inventory,
results, artifacts, and audit/read models. AX uses it to request product
actions and display Cloud-authoritative state.

Critical creation routes support the [v1 mutation idempotency contract](../specifications/MUTATION_IDEMPOTENCY.md)
through an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. AX retains keys for explicit retries;
connectivity restoration never replays Work execution automatically.

AX MUST NOT open a Workspace Runtime Protocol connection, construct runtime
messages, or authenticate as a Workspace machine. AX cannot dispatch an
assignment directly to a Workspace or provider CLI. Cloud authorizes and
schedules work, then dispatches it through the Workspace Runtime Protocol.
Workspace executes it with the generic CLI Worker Engine.

The Workspace desktop's owner-authenticated account and registration requests
remain explicitly scoped management routes on Cloud's human-authenticated HTTP
surface, as defined by ADR-013/ADR-014. They use the Human Product Protocol's
HTTPS management surface, not the Workspace Runtime Protocol. Those requests
do not carry runtime assignments and do not make the Workspace desktop an AX
client. The separate runtime credential and Workspace Runtime Protocol remain
required for machine participation.

## 2. Workspace ↔ Cloud — Workspace Runtime Protocol

**Endpoints:** the Conclave Workspace runtime and Cloud's Workspace Gateway.  
**Authentication:** a machine runtime credential bound to one Workspace
runtime, sent as a Bearer credential in the `Authorization` header. Runtime
credentials MUST NOT be accepted from WebSocket URL query parameters.
**Transport:** WSS is primary; HTTPS long-poll is the functional fallback.  
**Contract ownership:** the versioned Workspace Runtime Protocol schema and
Cloud Gateway implementation.

This protocol carries runtime hello/heartbeat, safe Worker inventory and
status, assignment delivery/acknowledgement/progress/results/errors, and
cancellation. Cloud scheduling and Workspace execution use this boundary;
transport choice does not change assignment semantics.

Cloud-facing Worker Type IDs are product concepts. Project and Workstream
policy, Workspace inventory, and assignment snapshots use IDs such as
`chatgpt` and `gemini`; internal Worker release identifiers are not accepted
in this protocol.
Cloud forwards the selected product Worker Type ID unchanged. Workspace
validates it against the selected local Worker slot, then resolves the admitted
Engine and compatible official Tool Profile Release for that logical Worker.
AX therefore does not need to know which Engine build or Profile implements a
product Worker.

Only Conclave Workspace speaks this protocol as a client. Cloud's Workspace
Gateway is its server. Conclave AX is not a runtime client. CLI Worker Engine
processes are not runtime clients and MUST NOT connect to Cloud, invoke
Workspace Gateway routes, or receive the Workspace runtime credential.
Workspace translates between runtime messages and Local Worker Protocol 4.0
frames.

The current implementation is named
`conclave.workspace-runtime-protocol` and is defined in
`packages/workspace-runtime-protocol/src/workspace-runtime.ts`. Keep its runtime identity,
authentication, transport negotiation, and assignment envelopes inside this
boundary.

## 3. Workspace ↔ CLI Worker Engine — Local Worker Protocol 4.0

**Endpoints:** Conclave Workspace process supervisor and one generic CLI Worker Engine child process.  
**Authentication:** local admission only; no Cloud/human credential is present.  
**Transport:** versioned NDJSON over stdin/stdout.  
**Contract ownership:** Workspace + shared protocol package; Engine implements it.

Protocol 4.0 carries:
- initialize;
- passive/live probe;
- execute;
- progress;
- result;
- error.

Initialize requests bind `workerTypeId`, `expectedEngineVersion`,
`profileDefinitionId`, `profileReleaseVersion`, the lowercase SHA-256
`profileDigest`, and `protocolVersion`. Initialize results confirm the logical
Worker Type, Engine version, Tool Profile definition/release/schema version,
and capabilities. Probe results may report only the bounded provider tool name
and version; executable paths are not part of the wire contract.
Probe requests carry an Engine-enforced `timeoutMs` ceiling of at most 30
seconds. For live probes, the Engine supplies the fixed Conclave test prompt
and requires exact final text `OK`; Profiles can define only provider transport
and output parsing.

Workspace owns Engine/Profile admission, process lifetime, local permissions, CWD, cancellation and safe Cloud synchronization. Workspace does not discover or invoke provider CLIs directly.

Cloud-to-Workspace assignments carry only the canonical execution permission
IDs `repository:read`, `repository:write`, `shell:execute`, and `network:use`.
Cloud derives its assignment set from Project role and Workspace Grant policy;
Workspace independently enforces that set against local Worker permissions.
Local permission identifiers are not aliases or Cloud-side boundaries.

The Engine owns provider execution through one Workspace-admitted signed Tool Profile. It may launch only the resolved provider CLI using structured arguments with shell execution disabled. It never receives Workspace runtime credentials and never connects directly to Cloud.

Tool Profiles are not protocol peers. They are signed immutable behavior configuration consumed locally by the Engine after Workspace trust/schema/compatibility admission. Profiles cannot disable Engine security invariants or add arbitrary process execution.

Provider credentials, provider session IDs, arbitrary Cloud executable paths, shell commands, and raw provider output are not Local Worker Protocol fields.

Local Worker Protocol 4.0 is the sole Workspace-to-Engine protocol contract.
Provider identity, release state, and executable paths do not cross this
boundary as caller-controlled values.

## Shared canonical domain vocabulary

These names describe Conclave domain values used across boundaries:

| Canonical name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ProjectId` | Stable identity of a collaboration Project |
| `WorkstreamId` | Stable identity of a persistent unit of work |
| `WorkspaceId` | Cloud identity of a registered machine Workspace |
| `WorkspaceRuntimeId` | Identity of the connected machine runtime |
| `WorkerId` | Identity of one Workspace-owned local Worker slot/configuration |
| `WorkerTypeId` | Stable product integration type, such as `chatgpt` or `gemini` |
| `AssignmentId` | Identity of one immutable unit of scheduled execution |
| `RunId` | Identity of the orchestration Run containing work |
| `TaskId` | Identity of one task within a Run |
| `WorkerReadiness` | Domain readiness state used for scheduling and display |
| `AssignmentStatus` | Domain lifecycle state for scheduled execution |
| `ErrorCode` | Stable machine-readable failure category |

These are canonical domain concepts, not a shared message envelope. At the
wire boundary, each protocol owns its own versioned schemas, required fields,
field names, validation, and authentication context. A value such as
`AssignmentId` may appear in multiple protocol payloads, but a Human Product
Protocol request, Workspace Runtime Protocol frame, and Local Worker Protocol
frame are never interchangeable. Do not import one protocol's envelope or
transport into another boundary to reuse these names.

The TypeScript/Dart or service-specific representations may remain distinct
while carrying the same canonical meaning. Changes to a canonical concept must
be reviewed across each affected boundary; this does not authorize merging the
wire contracts.

## Boundary ownership matrix

| Flow | Client | Server/process peer | Protocol | Credentials allowed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product and collaboration actions/read models | Conclave AX | Cloud human API/realtime | Human Product Protocol | Human session |
| Desktop owner/account management | Workspace management UI | Cloud management routes | Human Product Protocol, HTTPS management surface | Human session |
| Inventory, assignments, progress, cancellation | Workspace runtime | Cloud Workspace Gateway | Workspace Runtime Protocol | Workspace runtime credential |
| Local setup, readiness, execution, progress, result | Workspace supervisor | CLI Worker Engine process | Local Worker Protocol 4.0 | Bounded non-secret settings; no provider tokens or account secrets |

Cloud may translate and persist domain state between its product API and
Workspace Gateway. Workspace may translate between its Cloud runtime client
and CLI Worker Engine process. Neither translation forwards a wire envelope
unchanged across a boundary.

## Current schema locations

- Human Product Protocol: AX `apps/app/lib/src/ax/ax_data.dart` and
  `apps/app/lib/src/realtime/realtime_client.dart`; Cloud
  `apps/cloud/src/routes/handlers.ts` and `apps/cloud/src/realtime-gateway.ts`.
- Workspace Runtime Protocol: Workspace
  `apps/workspace/lib/cloud_connection.dart`; schema
  `packages/workspace-runtime-protocol/src/workspace-runtime.ts`; Cloud
  `apps/cloud/src/workspace-gateway.ts`.
- Local Worker Protocol 4.0: implemented by the Workspace supervisor
  `apps/workspace/lib/cli_worker_engine_supervisor.dart`, assignment handler
  `apps/workspace/lib/worker_executor.dart`, generic Engine
  `engines/cli_worker/lib/src/cli_worker_engine.dart`, and shared schema
  `packages/conclave_worker_protocol`.
- Canonical domain model: domain entities in `packages/core/src` and the
  canonical vocabulary in this document; wire validators remain protocol-owned.

Protocol binding generation covers the product envelope, Cloud Workspace
message metadata, and realtime event metadata. It does not generate Local
Worker Protocol bindings: `packages/conclave_worker_protocol` is the single
source for Worker Protocol 4.0 models and validation.

Discussion reads use the [versioned paging contract](../specifications/DISCUSSION_PAGING.md). AX retains shared cached history across page disposal,
synchronizes on reopening, and reconciles optimistic sends and edits per message.

Human Product realtime collaboration signals and independent durable Project/user
stream sequencing are specified in [Realtime synchronization 1.1](../specifications/REALTIME_SYNCHRONIZATION.md).
Existing execution Workspace envelopes remain compatible; this does not change
Workspace Runtime or Local Worker Protocol transport.

Workspace Project grant collections and the additive aggregate count in
`GET /api/workspaces` are Human Product HTTP read models. Their versioned
[read model contract 1.1](../specifications/WORKSPACE_PROJECT_GRANTS.md) preserves
existing mutation endpoints and authorization. Runtime inventory and grant
admission still belong to their existing Cloud/Workspace boundaries.
