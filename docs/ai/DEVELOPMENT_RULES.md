# AI Development Rules

## Before implementation
An AI worker must:
1. read AGENTS.md;
2. read the relevant specification/ADR;
3. inspect existing code/tests before proposing architecture;
4. state the exact phase/task being implemented;
5. avoid broad changes beyond that task.

## Implementation
- Prefer small commits and cohesive units.
- Keep domain logic provider-independent.
- Use interfaces at infrastructure boundaries.
- Validate all AI/tool responses before accepting them.
- Make state transitions explicit and testable.
- Do not rely on hidden conversation state for persistent workflow facts.
- Preserve ordered event/audit history for orchestration actions.
- Never log credentials or sensitive tokens.

## Tests
At minimum, behavior changes require:
- unit tests for domain rules/state transitions;
- schema/contract tests for protocol changes;
- integration tests for storage/provider/runtime boundaries where relevant.

Tests must verify failure paths, not only success paths.

## Documentation
Update documentation in the same task when changing:
- domain vocabulary;
- architecture;
- persistence;
- protocol/schema;
- security/permissions;
- public API;
- workflow semantics.

## Review handoff
Return:
1. summary;
2. files changed;
3. tests/checks and exact result;
4. documentation updated;
5. risks/assumptions;
6. recommended independent-review focus.
