# ADR-020: Person Grants and Workspace Access Policy

**Status:** Accepted (Cloud implemented, AX screens pending); **Date:** 2026-10-17

Extends ADR-008. It does not replace Space membership or Space roles.

## Context

ADR-008 makes the Space the collaboration boundary and lets a Space execute on
a Workspace through an explicit Space grant. Member access
(`workspace_member_access`, migration 0073) limits Workers, models and efforts
for invited Space members, but it is one policy for every member, and it cannot
express lending a Workspace to a person who owns their own Spaces. Two
different sharing situations were being treated as one.

## Decision

### Two sharing modes

| | A. Invite to my Space | B. Lend my Workspace to a person |
|---|---|---|
| Space and Threads owned by | the Workspace owner | the borrower |
| Owner sees Threads | yes (Space owner) | no |
| Owner controls | Space roles | Workspace access only |
| Runs on | the Space's Workspace | the lender's Workspace, through a Person Grant |

Mode A is unchanged. Mode B adds a **Person Grant**: a grant from a Workspace
owner to one named person.

### Three-layer rule

A request runs only if all three allow it:

1. **Space role** (what the person may do in the Space) — unchanged.
2. **Workspace access** (what the requester may run on that Workspace) — the
   requester's effective access policy.
3. **Workflow** (read-only or stateful) — bounded by the policy `mode`.

Effective permissions are the intersection. A lower layer never widens a higher
one. The check is always made on the actual requester, never on the Space owner.

### Access policy

- A Workspace has one **default policy** applied to every person without an
  override. Initial default for new people: `mode = chat`.
- A person may have an **override** that replaces the default entirely. Policies
  are never merged. "Reset to default" removes the override.
- A policy lists Workers, with optional model and effort limits (null means all),
  plus a `mode`:
  - `chat`: read-only Workflows only (Chat, Research, Plan);
  - `work`: stateful Workflows, limited by Space role permissions and the
    approved Work Root;
  - `work+shell`: additionally `shell:execute` and `network:use`.
- The Workspace owner is never restricted.

### Person Grants (lending)

- A Person Grant lets the named person's own Spaces and Threads use the
  lender's Workspace within the person's effective policy.
- **Strict:** the grant is non-transferable. Other members of the borrower's
  Spaces gain nothing from it; a request from them fails with a clear message
  unless they hold their own access. There is no delegation option.
- **No re-lending:** only a Workspace owner can create a grant on that
  Workspace.
- **Revocation** takes effect for running work at the next lease check, and
  every create, change and revoke is audited.
- `work` mode on a grant requires an explicit owner action and a chosen Work
  Root.

### Lender visibility: usage only

The lender sees usage per borrower: request counts, run time, Workers used and
last used. The lender never sees Space names, Thread titles, prompts, results
or artifacts of the borrower. Tests assert the response shapes.

### Quotas

Each grant carries a concurrent-request limit and a total run-time limit.

### Workspace invitations (amended 2026-10-17)

A Workspace owner lends a Workspace by **Workspace invitation**, sent by email.
Acceptance creates the Person Grant and nothing else.

- A Workspace invitation does **not** create a `people_relationships` row.
  `/api/people` stays automatic (shared Spaces only), read-only and
  search-free. Profile and avatar visibility, and Space-invite shortcuts that
  depend on that relationship, are unaffected by lending.
- The lender sees borrowers in a separate "People with access" list: display
  name, email, effective policy and usage. The borrower sees the Workspace name,
  its owner and what the grant allows.
- Invitations expire, can be revoked before acceptance, and are single-use.
  The invitee must sign in with the invited email to accept. Accepting twice,
  or after revocation or expiry, fails.
- Revoking an accepted grant ends it as described above. If the two people later
  share a Space, the normal automatic relationship appears independently.
- Per-person overrides apply to anyone with access: Space members from
  `/api/people` and borrowers from "People with access".

## Security invariant

> Running on a Workspace requires the requester's own current access. Space
> membership, the Space owner's access, and another person's grant never confer
> it.

## Consequences

- `workspace_member_access` becomes the default policy plus per-person
  overrides; enforcement stays in `resolveWorkflowExecutionBindings`.
- The v8 D1 schema is a fresh-start baseline, so schema changes edit the
  baseline rather than add a migration chain.
- Revocation latency depends on lease checks.
- Implementation follows the phases in `docs/roadmaps/PERSON_GRANTS_PHASES.md`.
