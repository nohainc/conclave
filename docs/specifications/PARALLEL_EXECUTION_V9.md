# Parallel execution and queue management

Phase 7 makes queueing an explicit part of the assignment lifecycle. Cloud
persists and dispatches assignments even when the selected Worker is at its
effective capacity. The Workspace Service is the final admission authority:
it atomically reserves a local slot, starts one isolated Engine process per
assignment, and transfers a released slot to the next waiter without changing
the assignment identity.

## Effective capacity

The immutable `maxConcurrentAssignments` in an assignment snapshot is the
intersection of the Cloud scheduling limit, the active Space grant, and the
Workspace-reported local limit. Workspace applies the smaller of that value
and its current local registry value. A missing legacy field falls back to the
local limit; a malformed value is rejected before Engine launch.

Cloud admission queue depth is durable in `worker_assignments.status =
'created'`. Queued assignments are counted for Worker load balancing but do
not claim a provider process. The Service owns the final slot reservation and
therefore remains the only place that can claim a live process slot.

## Deadlines

`timeoutMs` is the provider/Engine execution deadline and starts after local
slot admission. `queueWaitTimeoutMs` is an independent deadline beginning when
the assignment enters the local queue. The default queue deadline is two
minutes. Cloud workflow polling and stale-assignment recovery use the queue
deadline before startup and the execution deadline after the explicit
provider-start acknowledgement.

## Isolation and cancellation

Every admitted assignment has its own Engine process, process ownership
record, event correlation IDs, and cancellation path. Durable provider session
locks serialize attempts that intentionally resume the same native session;
different logical sessions can execute concurrently. Stateful repository
mutations continue to use the Space/Thread mutation coordinator, while
read-only assignments do not acquire that write lock.

Cancellation removes a queued waiter without releasing a slot it never held.
When a running assignment terminates, its slot is transferred atomically to
the next waiter. The transfer is marked reserved before the waiter resumes so
a cancellation racing with dequeue cannot launch an unwanted process.

## Recovery

Process ownership records remain durable under Application Support. Service
startup reaps only an exact Engine identity (executable, state directory and
start identity), then rebuilds capacity from the live supervisor state. A
terminal Cloud result remains idempotent by assignment and attempt identity;
transport reconnects do not re-execute an assignment.

## Compatibility

Older assignment payloads without `queueWaitTimeoutMs` or
`maxConcurrentAssignments` remain accepted during rollout. New Cloud payloads
always include both fields. The queue deadline is persisted in migration
`0055_assignment_queue_deadline.sql` so Cloud recovery does not mistake a
healthy local queue for a lost execution.
