## 1. Executive Summary

Conclave Profile Lab is an internal macOS desktop application (`apps/profile_lab`) dedicated to authoring, validating, sandbox testing, publishing, promoting, rolling back, and revoking Conclave Tool Profiles and Logical Workers.

Under Architecture v8, provider-specific Worker executables are replaced by one generic CLI Worker Engine (`engines/cli_worker`) configured by signed, immutable Tool Profiles. Vendor CLI tools evolve rapidly. Profile Lab is the operational control surface that enables engineers and maintainers to keep provider CLI integrations up to date without releasing new Workspace application binaries.

### Current release controls

Profile Lab stores complete sandbox evidence locally in the exact Cloud contract shape. Before publication, it submits that contract as local qualification for the exact draft digest; Cloud stores it immutably and requires its ID to sign and publish. After publication, an operator can submit a separate acceptance record for Stable promotion. Promotion references only the returned Cloud evidence ID; Profile Lab never includes evidence JSON in a promotion request.

The Profile Draft Assistant uses a Cloud-trusted Stable Worker Profile and the local generic CLI Worker Engine to request model-backed Draft proposals. Before each request, the operator confirms that the Draft and bounded test diagnostics may be sent through that provider CLI. Profile Lab does not collect or store provider credentials. The separate Repair Loop remains an experimental local heuristic. Both flows can propose Draft edits only; their output is never test evidence or acceptance evidence.

## 2. Product Boundaries & Architecture Surfaces

Conclave enforces a strict separation across four distinct product surfaces:

```text
+-----------------------+      +-----------------------+      +-----------------------+
|      Conclave AX      |      |   Conclave Workspace  |      |  Conclave Profile Lab |
+-----------------------+      +-----------------------+      +-----------------------+
| Human orchestration   |      | Local Work Root &     |      | Profile engineering   |
| Projects & Workstreams|      | reliable execution    |      | Draft authoring       |

+-----------------------+      +-----------------------+      +-----------------------+
           \                               |                             /
            \                              |                            /
             +---------------------------------------------------------+
             |                     Conclave Cloud                      |
             | Authoritative state, Worker catalog, signing boundary   |
             +---------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Boundary Rules:
1. **Conclave AX:** Web application for human project orchestration. Displays catalog workers and local readiness. Exposes zero profile editing or administration.
2. **Conclave Cloud:** Multi-tenant authoritative backend. Manages `worker_catalog`, `tool_profile_definitions`, `tool_profile_releases`, release channels, and Ed25519 cryptographic signatures. Executes zero provider tools.
3. **Conclave Workspace:** Background-first native desktop machine runtime. Manages local Work Roots, process tree execution, and local worker readiness. Consumes **only** cryptographically signed, admitted Tool Profile Releases.
4. **Conclave Profile Lab:** Administrative desktop engineering application. Authors and tests unsigned local Draft Profile candidates against installed provider CLIs in an isolated sandbox. Exposes full release lifecycle management. **Never registers as an execution Workspace, never accepts Work assignments, and never owns Project Work Roots.**

---

## 3. The Core Authority Chain

Logical Worker product identity is strictly decoupled from versioned implementation profiles:

```text
Worker Catalog (`worker_catalog`)
       ↓
Tool Profile Definition (`tool_profile_definitions`)
       ↓
Tool Profile Release (`tool_profile_releases`)
       ↓
Generic CLI Worker Engine (`engines/cli_worker`)
       ↓
Provider CLI (local executable binary)
```

No Worker identity (such as `chatgpt` or `gemini`) is hardcoded in Profile Lab, Workspace, or AX. Conclave Cloud is the sole authority for catalog descriptors and profile bindings. Adding a new Worker in Profile Lab makes it discoverable by Workspaces and selectable in AX without application redeployment or code modifications.

The Create Worker form starts new catalog entries in the `testing` release stage and offers only `testing`, `beta`, or `stable`. Capabilities are selected from the canonical Worker capability contract: `text`, `local_file`, `workstream_read`, `workstream_write`, `durable_session`, `image`, `audio`, and `video`.

Profile Lab executable discovery follows the same rule: it gathers executable names from the loaded Worker catalog's `providerToolName` and from Tool Profile `providerTool.name` and `providerTool.executableCandidates`. Profile-declared `standardLocations` are used for those candidates. Diagnostics list only the names found in loaded Worker/Profile data; the application does not maintain a built-in provider inventory. Session formats and resume arguments remain Profile data, and a failed session diagnostic does not let repair logic infer them from a provider name.

Profile Lab builds default to `https://app.conclaveax.com`. Development builds can set `CONCLAVE_CLOUD_URL=http://localhost:8787` with a Dart define or choose an origin in the Cloud connection settings. The settings override persists locally and can be reset to the build default. Cloud origins must be HTTPS except for loopback HTTP in development builds; URLs with credentials, paths, queries, or fragments are rejected. Saved Keychain sessions are bound to their Cloud origin and are cleared when the origin changes. Legacy sessions without origin binding are discarded.

### Profile Lab application boundaries

The `ProfileLabController` remains the UI-facing façade, with draft editing and sync, Engine testing, session handling, and Cloud administration implemented in separate controller components. `ProfileAdminApiClient` decodes Cloud reads into typed read models for Workers, definitions, releases, evidence, audit events, channel pointers, Workspace assignments, and signing preflight. The Tool Profile payload remains an open JSON object because its schema evolves independently. The controller currently converts Cloud read models to JSON-shaped presentation state so existing screens can migrate independently; new application logic should use typed read model fields directly.

---

## 4. Draft Authoring & Sandbox Testing

Profile Lab allows engineers to author and iteratively refine Draft Profiles before requesting a signed release:

- **Local Draft Store (`DraftProfileStore`):** Persists draft configurations locally under Profile Lab's dedicated application support directory (`~/Library/Application Support/conclave_profile_lab/drafts/`).
- **Unsigned Draft Candidate (`LocalDraftProfileCandidate`):** Implements `ToolProfileCandidate` with `isSigned => false`. Unsigned drafts are strictly barred from entering Workspace's trusted profile store (`ToolProfileReleaseStore`).
- **Sandbox Test Supervisor:** Uses `PlatformProcessSupervisor` from `conclave_cli_worker_runtime` to run tests out of process with hard execution deadlines, process tree cleanup, and secret redaction (`SafeProviderDiagnostics`).
- **Progressive Test Ladder:** Keeps schema, Engine compatibility, executable discovery, version, passive probe, and live probe as preflight stages. It then submits actual assignments through the generic CLI Worker Engine, including a file write verified inside the isolated sandbox. Session create/resume and model selection each submit real Engine assignments when the profile declares a testable capability; unsupported or untestable capabilities are shown as skipped, never passed.
- **Cancellation and Deadline Tests:** The Engine emits an internal start marker after the provider process is spawned; the host supervisor consumes it and wakes the ladder. Cancellation is requested as soon as that marker arrives, with no fixed sleep. The timeout case gives the provider a 100 ms Engine execution deadline after spawn while retaining a separate outer supervisor deadline. A stage passes only when the Engine reports the expected outcome and terminates the process tree. The operator can also cancel the currently active Engine assignment from the Test Bench.
- **Evidence Result:** The sandbox emits all eight Cloud scenario keys. It records `passed` only after observing an applicable scenario succeed and records `not_applicable` for model selection without an allowlisted test model, workstream writes without the `workstream_write` capability, or durable sessions the Tool Profile does not declare. Cloud independently derives the same expected statuses from the release Profile. Durable session capability and `session.supported` must agree. Failed or incomplete run diagnostics remain in the local Test Workbench and do not become acceptance evidence.
- **macOS CI Acceptance:** The Profile Lab macOS verification script builds the actual CLI Worker Engine executable from `engines/cli_worker`, saves and reloads an unsigned Profile Lab Draft through `DraftProfileStore`, and runs the full 11-stage ladder against a local fixture provider. The check requires the real Engine and every applicable scenario to pass, validates the resulting Cloud evidence contract against the Draft digest, and verifies sandbox cleanup. It uses no live provider account or credential.

---

## 5. Cryptographic Evidence & Release Publication

Profile Lab stores local sandbox contracts against the canonical payload SHA-256 digest. Before publication, it submits the matching contract to Cloud as local qualification. Cloud validates and stores the submitted contract, then returns an ID that the publish request must include. This is a digest-bound authenticated assertion, not remote attestation of the local process; only the supported Profile Lab client emits a contract after applicable Engine scenarios pass. The request carries no signature or signing-key ID. Before this flow, Profile Lab checks the admin-only Cloud signing preflight. Cloud verifies that its configured private key matches the public trust root for the configured publisher/key ID and that the key is not revoked. Publication repeats signer and qualification checks and fails closed if either is invalid or unavailable:

1. **Local Qualification:** The sandbox emits the capability-aware `ToolProfileAcceptanceEvidence` contract only when all required Engine scenarios pass. Cloud validates current draft identity/digest, reported Engine and provider compatibility, freshness, and required statuses, then stores an immutable qualification record before publication. Failed or incomplete ladder diagnostics remain in the Test Workbench and cannot qualify a draft through the supported client.
2. **Digest Invalidation:** Any mutation to a Draft Profile payload changes its SHA-256 `payloadDigest` and invalidates all previously gathered test evidence.
3. **Cloud Signing Boundary:** Cloud requires the stored qualification ID, reloads and validates it against the current draft, verifies release-manager scope (`profiles:release:manage`) and signer readiness, and signs the release using Cloud's Ed25519 private key. Stable promotion, Stable channel assignment, rollback, and revocation require a recent session-bound passkey step-up.
4. **Cloud Acceptance Evidence API:** After publication, Profile Lab can separately submit an acceptance contract for the signed release. Cloud validates it and returns an immutable acceptance evidence ID.
5. **Stable Promotion:** Profile Lab sends only the stored Cloud evidence ID. Cloud reloads and revalidates that record against the signed Profile and digest before promotion.
6. **Signed Admission (`ToolProfileReleaseAdmission`):** Returned to clients with `isSigned => true`. Production Workspaces load and verify these signed releases using public keys (`ReleaseTrustRoots`).

---

## 6. Release Lifecycle & Channel Promotion

Profile releases move through a controlled lifecycle managed via Profile Lab:

```text
Local Draft → Cloud Qualification → Published Release → Testing Channel → Beta Channel → Stable Channel
                                        |                |
                                     Rollback         Revocation
```

- **Channel Pointers:** Cloud maintains channel pointers (`workspace_tool_profile_channels`) pointing to release versions (`testing`, `beta`, `stable`).
- **Channel Promotion:** Promoting a release moves a pointer forward. The underlying profile payload and signature remain 100% immutable.
- **Rollback:** Pointing a channel backward to an earlier immutable release version instantly restores a known-good configuration.
- **Revocation:** Marking a release as revoked (`revoked_at` timestamp) causes Cloud and Workspaces to immediately refuse execution for that release version across all channels.

---

## 7. Model-backed Draft Proposals & Experimental Repair Loop

The AI Draft Assistant resolves available model runners from the Cloud Worker catalog's current Stable channel pointers. It verifies each Profile signature against build-injected public trust roots and applies Cloud's current signing-key and Profile revocations before offering a model. A selected signed Profile executes locally through the generic CLI Worker Engine; the unsigned Profile being edited is never used as the model runner. Model selection uses a Profile-declared allowlist where available and otherwise delegates to the provider CLI's configured default.

Before sending a request, the operator explicitly consents to sending the current Draft and bounded test diagnostics to the selected provider. Credential-like fields and secret-like values in the Draft are rejected. Provider authentication remains in the installed CLI. The response must be a complete schema-valid Profile and must preserve the Draft's Worker, Profile, release version, and provider identity. Profile Lab displays a domain diff and requires an explicit human review-and-apply action. Apply updates only the local Draft editor. Provenance is stored in local Draft metadata and never inserted into the signed Profile payload. Saving, local qualification, Cloud publication, and Stable promotion remain separate human-controlled workflows.

The separate Repair Loop remains an experimental local heuristic and is not model-backed:

1. **Iteration Workflow:** Generate candidate → Validate JSON schema → Run local probe suite → Normalize failure log → Apply local heuristic repair rules → Display diff → Retest.
2. **Iteration Ceilings:** Automatically caps iterations (default: 3) and requires explicit human confirmation before applying material changes.
3. **Proposal Provenance:** Draft metadata records:
   - Creator/Modifier origin (`human`, model-backed Draft Assistant, or experimental heuristic repair loop);
   - the selected Worker Profile and model identifier when model-backed;
   - Parent release version and digest;
   - Prompt/task reference;
   - Resulting diff digest.

Audit records provide clear operational history (e.g. *"Draft v20 created by AI-assisted change, reviewed by Vitalii, tested on Codex 0.188.0, published by controlled signer, promoted to Testing by Vitalii"*).

Profile Lab's `CONCLAVE_RELEASE_TRUST_KEYS_JSON` build define contains public Ed25519 trust roots only. If no valid root is configured, no model runner is offered. Production and development builds must receive the same managed public trust configuration used to validate Workspace Tool Profile releases.

---

## 8. Security Ceilings & Architecture Guards

Profile Lab enforces strict security boundaries verified by automated repository guards (`verify-v8-architecture.mjs`):

1. **Zero Direct D1 Access:** Profile Lab communicates exclusively via HTTPS REST endpoints (`ProfileAdminApiClient`). Direct database bindings (`D1Database`, raw SQL) are strictly prohibited.
2. **Zero Signing Seeds:** Signing private key seeds (`CONCLAVE_WORKSPACE_ED25519_SEED`, `Ed25519PrivateKey`) are forbidden in Profile Lab code. Signature generation belongs solely to Cloud.
3. **Secret Redaction:** Test output logs and diagnostic summaries undergo strict secret redaction preventing provider keys or desktop tokens from being stored in logs or evidence artifacts.
4. **Process Isolation:** Provider CLI processes run under bounded deadlines with full process tree termination upon completion or cancellation.

## 9. Manual Profile Lifecycle Completion & Autonomous AI Maintenance Governance

### Acceptance Criteria and Current Status

**Manual Profile lifecycle: COMPLETE** for the implemented control path. Profile Lab supports human Worker/Profile creation, Draft editing, local Engine qualification, Cloud-signed publication, channel management, and lifecycle administration. Fixture acceptance covers dynamic Workspace discovery, AX projection, and Work execution without Worker-specific source changes. Publication and Stable promotion reference separately stored Cloud qualification and acceptance records.

This status does not claim that all real-provider workflows pass or that a deployed Testing Workspace rollout has completed. The [real-provider acceptance record](../acceptance/real-provider/2026-10-03/README.md) documents provider-specific results and remaining rollout gates. Cloud validates the submitted evidence contract and binds it to the release digest, but does not remotely observe or attest to the local provider process; see the [evidence contract](TOOL_PROFILE_EVIDENCE_CONTRACT.md).

### Human Control and AI Proposal Boundary

Model-backed assistance is limited to proposing Draft edits within this human-controlled lifecycle:
- AI models propose state changes by generating draft candidate JSON payloads.
- Conclave owns persistent state, validates JSON schemas against `TOOL_PROFILE_LIMITS`, and enforces signature verification.
- The operator consents before Draft context and bounded diagnostics are sent, reviews the proposal diff, and explicitly applies it to the local Draft.
- Qualification, publication, signing, Stable promotion, rollback, and revocation remain separate human-controlled Cloud workflows.
- Proposal output is not qualification or acceptance evidence. Cloud's evidence contract is an authenticated assertion validated and bound to a release; it is not device attestation or independent proof of local execution.

### Provider compatibility

Provider compatibility starts incomplete for a new Draft. A successful
version probe can offer a narrow range beginning at the discovered version and
ending at the next minor boundary. Applying the suggestion saves the local
Draft; qualification must then be rerun. Cloud publication rejects missing or
obvious near-universal placeholder ranges.

## Tab activation and operation state

Navigation changes the selected tab synchronously and remains available during
Cloud refreshes, provider discovery, local tests, AI proposals, and release
operations. The controller schedules lazy loading after navigation; tab views
must not fetch data or notify the shared controller during construction.
The application activates the initial tab after its first frame and activates
the current tab after successful sign-in.

Concurrent refreshes coalesce by domain and resource identity (catalog,
Workspace channels, definition, definition releases, release evidence, and
scoped audit). Catalog and Workspace data load lazily, including successful
empty results; explicit Refresh retries or reloads them. Releases are keyed by
Definition. Evidence and audit refresh on activation. Loading and errors are
owned by their individual domains. Publication, Cloud save, promotion,
rollback, revocation, and Workspace channel updates disable only their
initiating actions. Operations continue when the operator changes tabs.
Responses for a previous Cloud origin/session or a superseded Definition or
release selection must not replace the current read model.

Workers distinguish sign-in required, not yet loaded, loading, successful
empty catalog, populated catalog, unauthorized access (HTTP 401/403), and
failed refresh. Failures display the actual error and Retry, including when
an older catalog remains visible. A malformed response is a failure, not an
empty catalog. Search with no matches has its own message. No built-in Worker
fallback exists: Cloud's `worker_catalog` and `tool_profile_definitions` remain
the shared source for Profile Lab and Workspace. The fresh v8 bootstrap seeds
ChatGPT and Gemini identities and Definitions, but no signed releases.

Regression coverage includes authenticated tab switching while catalog and
Workspace requests remain delayed, duplicate request coalescing, catalog
failure and unauthorized rendering, and the real admin catalog endpoint over
the fresh v8 database. These fixture checks do not establish deployed-service
or packaged desktop acceptance.

## Development access and unsigned execution

The checked-in Cloud configurations set
`CONCLAVE_PROFILE_LAB_OWNER_EMAIL=vitalii@nohainc.com`. When this setting is
present, only that active account with a verified email can approve, claim,
or use a Profile Lab desktop session or administer Profiles. The email is
resolved from Cloud's authenticated user record, never a client request field.
This exclusive policy replaces the user-ID admin and release-manager allowlists;
older allowlists cannot grant another account access. Browser authentication,
audience separation, credential rotation, and revocation remain in effect.
A blank configured owner denies everyone. Deployments without an owner setting
continue to require explicitly configured ID allowlists.

`GET /api/admin/profile-lab/access` requires authentication and returns the v1
access read model (`schemaVersion: 1`): authenticated identity/audience,
`permissions.profilesAdmin`, `permissions.releaseManager`, `releaseMode`, and
`signer.ready`/`signer.issues`. The Lab locks its content until Cloud verifies
administrative access. Its header shows Signed in until permission is verified,
then Profile Admin; the status strip reports release permission and signer state.
Check access retries the access read. Authentication alone never grants access.

The checked-in configurations use
`CONCLAVE_PROFILE_RELEASE_MODE=drafts-only`. Cloud publication returns 409 even
if signing keys happen to be configured, and signer preflight reports
`publication_disabled_for_development`. Draft creation, save, local qualification,
and sandbox tests remain available. The Lab disables publication until the
server reports both release permission and signer readiness. No signing identity
is created for development and no release rows are bootstrapped.

The unsigned exception also supports an explicitly opted-in local-development
Workspace. It uses `CONCLAVE_DEVELOPMENT_PROFILE_DIRECTORY` in a non-release build
and requires a loopback Cloud origin. It reads `<definition>/draft.json` from the
selected local directory (normally the Lab draft directory), validates Tool
Profile schema and catalog identity, and applies Engine/provider compatibility.
Each execution pins canonical bytes by digest in Workspace's separate
`development_profiles` directory. Drafts never become `ToolProfileReleaseAdmission`
and never enter the signed release store, channel pointers, or last-known-good
state. Edits apply to later resolutions, not already selected runs. Release
builds and remote Cloud connections reject this exception. The Workspace marks
it Unsigned / Local development. This supersedes the blanket unsigned exclusion
only for this bounded development path; production execution still uses signed
Profiles through the generic CLI Worker Engine.

For local development, start Cloud/AX with the existing local startup workflow,
then run `bash scripts/run-profile-lab-development.sh` and
`bash scripts/run-workspace-development.sh`. Both default to
`http://localhost:8787`; set `CONCLAVE_DEVELOPMENT_CLOUD_URL` to the same loopback
origin as your local Cloud. Sign in through the browser as the verified owner,
save and test a draft in the Lab, and refresh Workspace. The Workspace launcher
uses a separate DevelopmentState directory so existing production registration
is not reused. `CONCLAVE_DEVELOPMENT_PROFILE_DIRECTORY` overrides the source
and `CONCLAVE_WORKSPACE_DEVELOPMENT_DATA_DIR` overrides development state.

Profile Lab's macOS build script skips Developer ID signing and notarization by
default, including when signing environment variables are inherited. `--unsigned`
is explicit; signing requires `--sign IDENTITY`. The internal artifact workflow
currently builds unsigned development/testing artifacts and supplies managed
public trust roots when configured. Apple may still apply local ad-hoc signatures
needed to execute a development binary; this is not Developer ID signing,
notarization, or Tool Profile release signing.
