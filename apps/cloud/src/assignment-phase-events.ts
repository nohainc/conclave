 * Cloud just derived, but a client always re-reads the Work Request on
 * receipt. The idempotency key is per assignment and phase, so replays and
 * duplicate gateway messages publish at most one event per phase.
 *
 * Best effort by design. Phase notification must never fail or delay the
 * assignment transition that triggered it; a missed event is repaired by the
 * client's reconnect refresh.
