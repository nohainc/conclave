/**
 * Start fencing. A Service that advertises `assignment.start_permit.v1`
 * requests a permit immediately before it launches the provider process and
 * does not launch without a grant. Cloud grants a permit only while the
 * assignment is Acknowledged. Because revocation moves the assignment out of
 * Acknowledged with a conditional UPDATE, and a grant is a conditional UPDATE
 * that requires Acknowledged, exactly one of them wins:
 *
 * - grant first: `start_permit_issued_at` is set, a process may start, and a
 *   later revocation must wait for the Service to confirm the stop;
 * - revocation first: no later request can be granted, so if no permit was
 *   ever issued, no process exists or can ever exist and Cloud may finalize
 *   the revocation without waiting for the Service.
