# Conclave AX

**AI execution and orchestration ecosystem where models and AI tools plan,
delegate, build, review, test, and iterate toward verified outcomes.**

Primary domain: **conclaveax.com**

## Architecture

Architecture v8 is the active implementation target.

~~~text
Conclave AX
-> Conclave Cloud
-> Conclave Workspace
-> generic CLI Worker Engine
-> signed Tool Profile
-> provider CLI
~~~

The first v8 logical Workers remain:

~~~text
ChatGPT -> chatgpt-codex Profile -> Codex CLI
Gemini  -> gemini-antigravity Profile -> agy
~~~

Users continue to interact with ChatGPT/Gemini Workers. Engine/Profile versions
are implementation details shown only in Advanced Diagnostics.

## Applications

- **Conclave AX** — Flutter Web application for Spaces, Threads, Chat
  (discussion) and Work.
- **Conclave Cloud** — TypeScript/Cloudflare collaboration, scheduling,
  Workspace Gateway, Worker catalog and Profile release control plane.
- **Conclave Workspace** — native Flutter/Dart desktop execution/security
  supervisor.
- **Conclave Profile Lab** — internal macOS Flutter/Dart engineering desktop
  application for Worker and Tool Profile authoring, testing, and lifecycle
  management.
- **CLI Worker Engine** — one standalone Dart console executable used for
  supported local CLI Workers.
- **Tool Profiles** — signed immutable official provider integration releases.

## Repository checks

Run `pnpm check` from the repository root to verify architecture and schema
consistency, generated protocol and Wrangler bindings, TypeScript formatting,
lint and builds, Cloud tests, Dart formatting and analysis across all Dart
packages, Workspace and AX Flutter tests, and fixture acceptance flows. The
command requires Node.js, pnpm, Dart, and Flutter.

`./scripts/start-local.sh` starts the AX frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
and a local API gateway on `http://localhost:8787`. By default the gateway
forwards HTTP and WebSocket requests to production Cloud, using existing
accounts, remote data and Workspace connections. Actions affect live data.
Authentication cookies are adapted to localhost while retaining HttpOnly;
production authentication secrets stay on Cloud. This mode tests local AX UI
changes against deployed Cloud behavior, rather than executing local backend changes.
Stop previous frontend/backend processes before restarting the launcher.

Use `./scripts/start-local.sh --isolated` to test local backend changes with
the local v8 D1 database and separate accounts. In this mode the launcher
generates a persistent local authentication secret in the ignored
`apps/cloud/.dev.vars` file, preserving existing settings and limiting file access
to its owner. Local email sign-in uses the local account database, so create a
local account first if needed; hosted accounts are separate. If an already
running backend reports “Authentication is not configured”, run
`node scripts/setup-development-auth.mjs` and restart the local backend.
Neither mode runs migrations or deploys production code.

## Work v1

Conclave defines fixed canonical Steps:

~~~text
Research
Plan
Implement
Test
Verify
~~~

and built-in Workflows:

~~~text
Direct
Research
Plan & Implement
Implement & Verify
Full Cycle
~~~

Threads bind those Steps to logical Workers. Users do not build arbitrary
Workflow graphs or edit Conclave's internal orchestration prompts in v1.

## Technology stack

- Flutter + Dart for AX and Conclave Workspace.
- TypeScript for Conclave Cloud.
- Dart AOT for the generic CLI Worker Engine.
- Cloudflare Workers + Workflows + Durable Objects.
- Cloudflare D1 for structured state.
- Cloudflare R2 where release/artifact payload storage is appropriate.
- Better Auth for human authentication.
- Local Worker Protocol 4.0 between Workspace and CLI Worker Engine.
- Signed Tool Profile v1 releases for provider CLI behavior.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- Wrangler for Cloudflare deployment.

## Key concepts

- **Space** — collaboration/history/authorization boundary.
- **Thread** — persistent unit of work and local working directory.
- **Workspace** — one machine-backed execution environment.
- **Worker Type** — stable product AI/tool identity such as `chatgpt` or
  `gemini`.
- **CLI Worker Engine** — generic local executor/interpreter; not a user-facing
  Worker.
- **Tool Profile** — signed provider integration configuration used by the
  Engine.
- **Provider CLI** — local tool that owns provider authentication/session/billing
  mode.
- **Workspace Grant** — Space authorization to use a Workspace.
- **Assignment** — immutable execution snapshot resolving Space + Thread +
  logical Worker + runtime evidence.

## Runtime trust boundary

Workspace supervises Engine processes but does not implement provider behavior.

The Engine:
- loads a Workspace-admitted signed Profile;
- finds/probes the provider CLI;
- launches it without a shell;
- parses its bounded output;
- enforces session continuity;
- normalizes progress/result/error.

Profiles cannot disable Engine/Workspace security invariants.

Provider secrets never enter Conclave Cloud.
