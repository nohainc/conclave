Usage: scripts/run-workspace-service.sh [--source] [service options]

Starts the compiled Workspace Service by default. Build it first with:
  scripts/build-workspace-service.sh

Use --source only for Dart source debugging; that mode displays as dart: in
process tools because it is launched through the Dart VM.
